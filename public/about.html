<h1>Adam Wentz</h1>
<p>Adam lives in Northeast Florida with his way-out-of-his-league wife of 10 years and his two fantastic (read: usually bonkers) kids. He has been in technology since 2019
  and has since discovered a deep love and passion for development of all types (and some question a certain masochism as well). He is entirely self-taught, and is really
  just waiting for his opportunity to show his knowledge and passion to the right people. Are you the right people? Please be the right people.

  The majority of Adam's development and programming experience is in C#. Adam is a contract game developer for a company that makes virtual reality games for physical rehab purposes,
  which are used to help practitioners and patients make rehab fun, challenging, engaging, and productive, and he's very proud of it (and he'll let you know). These games are made in
  the Unity game engine and written in C#. In addition to games, Adam has also developed a number of personal projects using .NET and specifically the MVC pattern, but is too embarrased
  and ashamed to share them with anyone, which is saying a lot considering how this website looks. Adam also has experience in Python, having studied AWS Lambda functions using Boto3.
  He is using this website as a means to study JS technologies and Postgres because he wants to actually learn something useful for once.

  Ideally, Adam would love a career in which he can make cool apps/websites/games, make a comfortable living doing it, and do it from wherever in the world he happens to be (Adam 
  likes to travel). He's dedicated to learning the latest technologies and utilizing them in creative ways to build unique, top tier software that people like to use. If he can achieve
  that in his lifetime, whenever the great beyond comes calling, he can answer without any regrets.
